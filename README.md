# Wissing_and_Eschholz_LC-transduction
This repository contains custom MATLAB-code to analyze 
(1) the efficacy and specificity of transgene expression in coronal LC slices as derived from confocal imaging and CellPose
(2) the effects immunostaining of eGFP as compared to native eGFP expression,
(3) the spatial extend of viral spread for AAV-based transduction of the LC. 

The code belongs to the manuscript "A comparison of viral strategies and model systems to target norepinephrine neurons in the locus coeruleus reveals 
high variability in transgene expression patterns", published in PLOS Biology, 2025.
